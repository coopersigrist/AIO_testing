# X-CAMP AI Masters Testing Material
This is material written for use by [X-CAMP](https://x-camp.academy/) Instructors of the AI Grandmaster and AI Master courses. It is a collection of tests written to mimic [the USAIO qualifying exams](https://forum.beaver-edge.ai/c/ai-olympiads/usa-north-america-ai-olympiad/8).

## Full Mock Tests:
The "Full Mock Tests" folder contains mimicries of the AIO Round 2 Qualifying exam increasing in difficulty from 1 to 4. Paced at 3 hours total to complete 3 python notebooks split into parts with point totals adding up to 100 per notebook. These should be spaced out between the course, though weighted toward the end -- these serve as a test of endurance and speed primarily (though of course you have to know your stuff).

These should be taken live and submitted after a hard 3 hour deadline. They may, of course, revisit them for practice, but we grade purely what they finished in 3 hours.

## Tests:
The "Tests" folder contains individual mock questions paced at roughly 1 hour per and explicit times are given instead of points to help them learn pacing. These should be given weekly (or daily paried with a mock test for a weeklong version of the course). These serve as a buildup in difficulty as they prepare for the mock tests. The intention is for students to submit both a timed (1 hour live) version as well as an untimed version which they submit under the expectation of their being 0 errors (online resources are allowed). The Bonus tests can be given at the Instructor's discretion, they are more fun but also more difficult -- it can be offered to high performing students who enjoy the material and want to be challenged.

Currently some test overlap with the full mock tests -- repitition is okay though not ideal, if able only offer them one iteration in a place of your choosing.
